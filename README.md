### Object-oriented programming 2 (OBJ2100)

This is a repo consisting of the programs as featured in the course book _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_. As per usual the "during-chapter" programs will be found with descriptive file names and the "after-chapter" programming exercises, referred to as "section" in the course book will be featured in the list beneath the __Objectives__-list with descriptive names and hyperlinks to its respective GitHub URL instead

---

__Objectives__
> - To describe what a recursive method is and the benefits of using recursion
> - To develop recursive methods for recursive mathematical functions
> - To explain how recursive method calls are handled in a call stack
> - To solve problems using recursion
> - To use an overloaded helper method to design a recursive method
> - To implement a selection sort using recursion
> - To implement a binary search using recursion
> - To get the directory size using recursion
> - To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion
> - To draw fractals using recursion
> - To discover the relationship and difference between recursion and iteration
> - To know tail-recursive methods and why they are desirable  
> (Liang, 2020, p. 741)[^1]

__Section classes__
The __section__ classes are programming exercises. These come after each chapter instead of during the chapters as the __listing__ class does. `*` and `**` denotes heightened difficulty according to the course book editors.
